Acknowledgments
The translators would like to thank, first of all, the anonymous transcriber and the publisher of the recordings of Dudjom Rinpocheâ€™s teachings. In addition, we owe a special debt of gratitude to Trulshik Rinpoche, who graciously composed the preface to the book and gave his blessing to the entire project. We are also very grateful to our teachers Pema Wangyal Rinpoche, Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche, and especially Rangdrol Rinpoche, who on numerous occasions gave us much help with the text and generally made the translation possible. Last but not least, we would like to thank our readers, Jenny Kane, Steve Gethin, and Vivian Kurz, for their generous help and valuable suggestions. The translation was made by Helena Blankleder and Wulstan Fletcher of the Padmakara Translation Group.
The Padmakara Translation Group gratefully acknowledges the generous support of the Tsadra Foundation in sponsoring the translation of this book.
